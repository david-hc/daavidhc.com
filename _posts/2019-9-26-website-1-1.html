desc: Adding and changing small details

<p>
  There will be always a room for improvement. Yet, seeking for perfection is not our job. I always
  trying to improve anything around me including myself and my website. In this specific post, I've
  improve this website for a little bit. Some are almost unnoticeable, still it's a part of improvement.
</p>
<h4>What is 1.1? How about 2.0</h4>
<p>
  The reason behind 1.1 is because the improvement is not really big. Only small details I fixed and
  changed. Some are really crucial to change. I also might make additional changes further. I address
  few changes below.
</p>
<h4>Profile Picture</h4>

  My awkward pose. This image was taken in 2018 by my sister with my smartphone camera.

<p>
  No personal website or about section completed without the picture of yourself. It's not supposed to
  be empty at the first place. Your profile image is the best way for reader to identify you. Therefore,
  I put my own <del>sad</del> picture.
</p>
<p>
  The reason behind why I'm not doing this at first, It's because I could not find a proper picture.
  I do not have a lot of personal picture, not to mention I'm somehow dislike being photographed.
</p>
<h4>Copyright Notice</h4>
<p>
  I started to realize this importance when I wrote a blog post week ago. I thought this blog will
  always be filled with original content and words. I must prevent content-thief as a part of self
  appreciation. It's my works dude!
</p>
<p>
  Copyright text always on the footer section of a website. I put mine just below the footer column
  for navigation. Really simple, straight forward, and important.
</p>
<h4>Contact Link's Label and Title</h4>
<p>
  I acknowledged this issue already, but never have the time to fix it. So here is it! before the changes
  the label for email link is 'Inquire'. But I thought it's somewhat unusual word for some peoples. I
  replaced it with 'Contact' as it's more common to see.
</p>
<p>
  I also changed the title into something more clear. Title is the text appear when you hover on a
  link. It's now written 'Mail me at daavidhc@gmail.com' instead of only 'Inquire'. According to your
  personal judgement, which one is much more easier to understand?
</p>
<p>
  It's also fixed the issue where mailto link do nothing when clicked if no email client is installed
  on your local computer or no action is set when mailto link is clicked. It's an issue where I'm the
  owner cannot fix because it's completely your computer's problem. By showing my email as the link title
  ensure user still could email me with 3rd party application such as Gmail.
</p>
<h4>Blockquote's left padding</h4>
<p>
  I used vw (viewport width) unit to determine blockquote left padding. But I noticed inconsistency in
  styling because vw is a relative unit. It's basically based on user's monitor resolution. Wider screen
  results in bigger number. Therefore, I changed it to px which is an absolute unit. It appears
  consistently among all screen size.
</p>
<h4>Sir Rp, I really want to hear from you</h4>
