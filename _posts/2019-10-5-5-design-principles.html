title: My 5 Web Design Principles
lang: en
---
<p>
  Everyone have their own way to design their websites. Some people prefer this way over another way. But those 5
  are my principles.
</p>
<h4>1. Simple Design</h4>
<p>
  Simple design gave me a lot of advantages over complicated design system. Simple design creates
  familiarity for our visitors. It helps visitor to scan website faster. They know where is the start
  to put their eyes.
</p>
<p>
  Complicated design sometimes confuse visitors. It looks so weird and not familiar. Therefore,
  visitor need time to know where is the point of start. That's why sometimes mainstream design is better.
  It just works for most of us, and we will not complaining.
</p>

<h4>2. Performance</h4>
<p>
  I want the best performance for my website. Always aim for the peak of performance. Loading speed time
  makes us suffer the most. I believe you will press the back button if a website failed to load in 5 seconds.
  It's a loss of visitor because of poor website performance.
</p>
<p>
  Some performance optimizations that I like to do are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resources Minification (CSS, HTML, Javascript, Image, etc)</li>
  <li>Using CDN to fasten up resources load time</li>
  <li>Using WOFF2/WOFF font file only</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Code to the barebone</h4>
<p>
  What I mean by barebone here is code to the simplest form, period. Something that unnecessary,
  will never be included in my code such as browser-prefixes for standard css property. It will only
  become a burden in the future, and will be a hit on website performance. Take a look at the code below
</p>
<pre>
.element {
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
  -o-box-sizing: border-box;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</pre>
<p>
  Code above is a mess in 2019. Box-sizing property do not need browser-prefixes anymore because it's supported
  in all modern browsers. Not to mention, lesser code mean lesser chance for coding error.
</p>

<h4>3. Typography First</h4>
<p>
  Typography started to become my first consideration when designing a website. Even before I start to play with code,
  I always looking for some typefaces that interest me the most. From my typefaces choices, I design the layout and color
  around the characteristic of the typefaces.
</p>
<p>
  Good designed paragraph, heading, etc also ensure a website to have a good readability. If visitors can't see the text
  because it's too small or too thin. Then, consider changing the way how you treat the typography. You've failed.
</p>

<h4>4. Monochromatic Color of Black</h4>
<p>
  Speaking of my favorite color pallete, monochromatic black color to white is my prefered color. It's a
  neutral color and easy on eyes. It also create the dead-feeling of color theme, somehow I really like it.
  I know I should not do this, this preference is purely my ego.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, there is a lot of possibility with color. You cannot set your standard to only black or white.
  You will not fulfil your client's expectation with only monochromatic color. Try to adapt and follow the trends.
</p>

<h4>5. Mobile Ready Design</h4>
<p>
  Mobile ready or responsive web design is a website's ability to adapt itself into certain size of media screen.
  Have you ever seen a website that looks so bad on your smartphone? They probably failed in responsive design.
</p>
<p>
  Responsive design is a must in 2019, since there are more people view your website with their smartphone than computer.
  You will lose a big proportion of visits if your website is not mobile-ready.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  Those 5 are my main principles when I start design a website. It's purely my preferences. You shall follow or leave it.
  I just like to design it in those ways. It give me the feel of satisfaction.
