  Apart from my design specialty and task as a Business Administration student. There is something that I can't
  live without; my watches. It became my hobby since the end of last year. I collected around 20 pieces of watches
  that I really liked. But only mechanical watches, not usuual quartz powered watches.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I would like to reviewing one of my latest piece. It's a Dunhill Centenary 100th 1993 Reissue Model with octagon case.
  To be honest, Dunhill is kind a brand that I avoid since they are producing luxury goods for men but not watch. It's not their
  specialist of making a wrist watch.
</p>
<p>
  But, there are something that I like in this particular piece from Dunhill.
</p>
<h4>It's a Limited Edition Piece</h4>

<blockquote>
  In 1993, Dunhill released a collection of “Centenary” watches for the one hundredth anniversary of the company. They were all steel and all reproductions
  of earlier Dunhill models. They were also all provided with mechanical movements.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Dunhill Centenary is one of their limited edition piece that came out in 1993. This state of Limited Edition ensure their price to
  never go down anytime. It will hold it's own value; overtime, the value will rise. Wearing a limited edition and luxury piece give me
  pride. It's not the same with the pride of Daniel Wellington or your Fossil watches.
</p>
<h4>It Housed a Mechanical Movement</h4>
<p>
  Mechanical movement is watch movement that their power not generated by battery or electricity but instead a mainspring. This ensure their life span to infinite
  as long as the watch is regularly serviced. It will last so much longer than battery powered watch. This particular piece powered by ETA 2660 movement.

<h4>Beautiful Blue Hands</h4>

  Blue colored watch hands really symbolize elegance for me. It's so unusual and unique. It give the particular watch a characteristic that no other watch give.
  To reach this color for a steel material also not easy. It's not painted with some kind of paint. The hands are burned into certain degree to give the blue color.

<h4>Breguet Style Numerals</h4>

<p>
  Breguet style numerals was originally designed by obviously Breguet itself in around 1790. Yep, it lasted 200 years. Other watch brands also continue to use this
  style of numerals including Cartier, Omega and Dunhill. It's a cursive writing styl which beautiful indeed.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  I can't be much more happier to obtain this watch this week. I got it this week. It's a watch that I would wear everytime I wear a blazer and long black pants.
  This piece offer the elegance that I'm looking for since the first time I started watch collecting. It's only one of my collection, I could share some more if
  you like.
