  There are a lot of things in this world that could change your life. Maybe you're engaged, married,
  celebrating your new born child. It's an endless possibilities. But here's my very own story,
  the money I spent on the christmas night of 2018. That small purchase changed my life in 2019. Well,
  how could a 80 bucks changed someone else's life? Here's how
</p>
<p>
  In the end of 2018, where I'm in the mid of university life. At that time, I already have my own
  bank account. I surfed the instagram and the web just to cure my want to own a watch. I actually have one,
  which is a gift from my father. But it's just not the right one for me. I bought a mechanical watch
  from a seller in Instagram platform. I'm a pretty new guy to the world of mechanical watch. So, it's my first
  piece.

    Chronometer which means precision standards.

<p>
  It's the Seiko Champion Calendar 860. It's also marks my love with Japanese watches especially Seiko. They are
  beautiful made. In my particular watch and model, it was produced in 1964 and only produced until 1971. The
  quantity in the world is very limited.
</p>
<h4>What is the Changes?</h4>
<p>
  There are two things that changes from me. They are
</p>
<h4>Habit of Wearing a Watch</h4>
<p>
  When you own a beautiful watch. It's not something that you keep at your wardrobe all the time. You wear it.
  It's their purpose of life. To tell you time. I wear my watch whenever I go outside. Time by time,
  there is a moment where I cannot go out without my watch. This develop my habits of being on time.
  Whenever I see my watch, I know the time. When is my class start, etc.

<p>
  This is the only good thing from my purchase. But.
</p>
<h4>I Developed an Addiction in Collecting Watches</h4>
<p>
  I find out this matter me the most. I come addicted to collecting more and more watches. Until now, October;
  I have around 20 watches in my collection. Sometimes, I always thinking which watch to wear today. I hate it.
  It cost me a lot of money, fortunately they could hold their value pretty well. Reselling in the future would not
  be a problem.
</p>
<p>
  Still, I really hate myself that I made a purchase of my first mechanical watch or atleast I should limit myself
  back then. But, the reality is different. I'm a broke and sad boy with a lot of watches.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  There's a time I regret everything. Fortunately, those watches sometimes attract a lot of people. They want to buy it
  from me. We just can't find the deal. I have a lot of watches guy friends. I even sell them at Tokopedia or Bukalapak.
  Roughly, 1 sales in 2 months. It's extremely low, but it helps to reduce my collection and gaining profit purely by me.
