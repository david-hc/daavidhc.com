<p>
  Over 5 years since I was in senior high school. I have a different taste of music than others. I
  listened a lot of classical pieces such as Chopin, Mozart, Bach and other classical composers. Even
  my mom said I have a 'weird' taste in music. It's sleepy and so boring. Then, I finally understand
  not everyone could get the essence of classical music.
</p>
<p>
  Late 2019, maybe around November. When I was in President University Student Housing. I thought,
  playing guitar is dream life goal. Apart of it's really cool especially among girls, guitar is pretty
  affordable anywhere. There is a lot of friends who could play the guitar. I could ask for help. Then,
  I bought my first guitar; the Yamaha Classical C315
</p>
<p>
  The first month was really tough. I started from 0. It's a pain in the ass. My fingers are so stiff,
  hurts, and could not play for more than 30 minutes because lacking of proper techniques. But, still
  that is the fun part of learning. I'm a self-taught musician, I learned a lot from Youtube by watching
  videos or reading <a href="https://www.classicalguitardelcamp.com" target="_blank">Classical Guitar Del Camp</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Next 6 months, I could do the chord change properly. But, one chord that always blocking me from being good
  is the F chord. It's so hard because of the barre chord. I always play the guitar, everyday practicing
  atleast 2 hours a day. It's my commitment for classical guitar. By that time, I keep improving time by time.

  Until November 2018, I quickly realized if my instrument could not keep up with my capabilities. It's an
  instrument limitation. I hate the sound quality, the vibrato and it's just looks so ugly. I wan't something
  better at every aspects. Spending few days of searching, I finally bought a Yamaha CG122MS. It's a solid spruce top model.
</p>
<p>
  At that phase, I learned a lot of classical pieces already. I played quite few of Bach, Barrios, Napoleon Coste, etc.
  I learned reading tablature. I'm so glad that I did, I'm excel at it now. But still, I could not find the
  relationship with my guitar. We're not a match. The string action is too high, fretting is so hard, sound quality
  is very harsh.
</p>
<p>
  That guitar only lasted 3-4 weeks until I decided to buy another one. It's my current guitar, It took me
  so long to think about it whether I should buy or not. Then I go for it, in the end. It cost more than 3x than
  my CG122MS. That's why it took me so long.
</p>
<p>
  It's a classical guitar made by RB Guitar, Bandung. It's a local made guitar with high quality wood. Constructed
  from solid wood. Solid spruce top, solid rosewood back and side, mahogany neck, ebony fretboard and mahogany bridge.
  I'm more than happy to play it. At this time, I didn't practice a lot, I'm still looking for my perfect instrument.

  By the time it arrives to Cikarang. I immediately give it a try. It sounds like "Soft Creamy Chocolate" in the morning.
  Soft tone and beautiful vibrato. It's also quite heavy compared to other guitar. I practiced everyday starting from that
  day. Until now. Take a look at my guitar <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BsxXqPjgfO8/" target="_blank">here</a>.

  October 2019, I'm in Lower Advanced group. I played a lot of Bach. Currently I focus on 1004 Chaconne by Bach, it's
  a virtuoso-level piece. At this moment, I really want to have my own musical album but you are welcomed to view my playing
